# PoetixWebsite

This is the repository for the web server that generates limericks on-demand with our transformer model. 

The full site is served in Django with no other frameworks or plugins required. To run the website locally, do:

```
pip install django
```
cd into the repository, and do:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
The website will show up on http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
